A packet sniffer also known as a protocol analyzer is used to monitor network traffic. Sniffers work by examining streams of data packets that flow between computers on a network as well as between networked computers and the larger Internet.
The current Python implementation captures only IPv4 packets and provides the following info:
•	Destination and Source MAC address
•	Ethernet Protocol
•	Protocol used 
•	TTL (Time-to-Live)
•	Header length
